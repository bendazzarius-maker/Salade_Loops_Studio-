/** ANALYSIS: Detects the fundamental frequency (Hz) and identifies the Root Key with semitones of the imported sample **/

/** INTERPOLATION: Calculates the playback rate ratio to map the sample across the Piano Roll keys based on the Root Key **/

/** SUSTAIN: Defines the Loop Start and Loop End points to create a continuous sound during long note presses **/

/** VISUAL RENDERING: Draws the sample waveform on canvas including interactive markers for playback, loop, and sustain **/

/** AUDIO ENGINE: Triggers the interpolated audio signal and routes it in real-time to the centralized Mixer Engine **/

/** CROSSFADE: Applies a smooth fade-in/out at loop points to eliminate audible clicks during sustain cycles **/
